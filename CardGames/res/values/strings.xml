    <string name="game_rules_text">The basic game of Crazy Eights is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. Each player will be dealt five cards and the rest of the cards will be put into a draw pile which is placed face down on the playing table. After the cards are dealt, one card will be taken from and placed next to the draw pile face up. This will serve as the discard pile.

The game will start with player 1 and continue in a counterclockwise fashion around the table. During each turn a player will either need to play a pile from his/her hand or select one card from the draw pile.
\n\n
Basic Game Play:\n	
1. If the top card is not an eight then a player must play a card that matches suit or the number of the last card in the discard pile.\n
2. An eight of any suit may be played at anytime during a players turn. If they choose to play an eight they must declare a suit.\n
3. If an eight is present on the top of the discard pile then a card of the declared suit or another eight can be played.\n
4. A draw will serve as a turn if a player cannot play a card.\n
5. If the first card turned up for the discard pile is an eight, any card from player 1’s hand can be played as the first card. After this, the standard above rules apply.\n
\n

The first player to successfully get rid of all of their cards wins the game. If at any point in the game the draw pile is empty, all of the cards from the discard pile except for the top card will be re-shuffled to form a new draw pile.</string>

    <!-- About Activity -->
    <string name="about_text_gameboard">This 2–4 player card game application requires one Android tablet per game and one Android device of any kind per player, all of which should have Bluetooth capabilities.  The tablet will serve as the game board, and each of the player’s devices will contain their hands of cards.  The tablet will connect to each of the devices via Bluetooth, and it will handle all logic and communication between these devices.\n\nTo start a game, press Create Game on the tablet that you will be using as your game board. All of the players’ devices should have a button that says Play on their Main Menu, which they should press to display a list of Bluetooth devices nearby. They should then select the tablet’s Bluetooth ID (appears on top left corner of tablet screen) from the device list to initiate a connection. Once a connection has been established between the tablet and a device, the player will be prompted to enter their name. Once all connected players have entered their name, the Start button can be pressed on the tablet and the game will begin.</string>
