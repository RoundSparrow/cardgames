Once this has been done, first select Create Game from the Main Menu of this application, and then select Join Game from the Main Menu on each player’s device.

    <string name="Information_rules">The basic game of Crazy Eights is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. Each player will be dealt five cards and the rest of the cards will be put into a draw pile which is placed face down on the playing table. After the cards are dealt, one card will be taken from and placed next to the draw pile face up. This will serve as the discard pile.

The game will start with player 1 and continue in a counterclockwise fashion around the table. During each turn a player will either need to play a pile from his/her hand or select one card from the draw pile.
\n\n
Basic Game Play:\n	
1. If the top card is not an eight then a player must play a card that matches suit or the number of the last card in the discard pile.\n
2. An eight of any suit may be played at anytime during a players turn. If they choose to play an eight they must declare a suit.\n
3. If an eight is present on the top of the discard pile then a card of the declared suit or another eight can be played.\n
4. A draw will serve as a turn if a player cannot play a card.\n
5. If the first card turned up for the discard pile is an eight, any card from player 1’s hand can be played as the first card. After this, the standard above rules apply.\n
\n

The first player to successfully get rid of all of their cards wins the game. If at any point in the game the draw pile is empty, all of the cards from the discard pile except for the top card will be re-shuffled to form a new draw pile.</string>
